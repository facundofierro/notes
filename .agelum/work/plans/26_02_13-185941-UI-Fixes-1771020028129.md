# Implementation Plan - UI Fixes (Logo & Screenshot)

This plan outlines the steps to relocate the logo to the top right with a vertical layout and move the application screenshot to a dedicated section for better visibility.

## User Requirements
1. **Logo:** Move to the top right. Change layout so "notes" is below "Agelum" (respecting the web app's design).
2. **Screenshot:** Move to the next section to make it bigger.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Style Updates (`apps/site/src/app/globals.css`)

#### Header and Navigation
- Create a `.top-nav` class to handle the positioning of the logo at the top right of the container.
- Use `display: flex; justify-content: flex-end;` for the navigation container.

#### Logo Layout
- Update `.brand-logo` to support a vertical stack:
  - `display: flex;`
  - `flex-direction: column;`
  - `align-items: flex-end;`
- Update `.brand-notes` to align with the "Agelum" text:
  - Use a negative `margin-top` (approx `-0.6rem` to `-0.8rem`) to pull "notes" closer to the baseline of "Agelum".
  - Ensure the rotation and font styles remain consistent.

#### Hero and Screenshot Sections
- Modify `.hero-grid` to handle a single-column layout if the grid is no longer needed, or center the hero content.
- Ensure `.screenshot-frame` is styled for full container width visibility.

### 2. Component Updates (`apps/site/src/app/page.tsx`)

#### Structural Changes
- **Add Header:** Insert a `<header className="container top-nav">` at the beginning of the `HomePage` component.
- **Relocate Logo:** Move the `brand-logo` markup into this new header.
- **Update Hero Section:** 
  - Remove the logo from the hero content area.
  - Remove the `screenshot-frame` from the `hero-grid`.
  - Simplify the hero content layout (e.g., center text or adjust column widths).
- **New Screenshot Section:**
  - Create a new `<section className="section">` immediately following the hero section.
  - Insert the `screenshot-frame` inside a `.container` within this section.
  - Update the `Image` component's `width` and `height` properties if necessary to support the larger display size.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Logo and Header
1. Update `globals.css` with the new `.top-nav` and vertical `.brand-logo` styles.
2. Modify `page.tsx` to add the header and move the logo.
3. Verify the logo's position and vertical alignment.

### Phase 2: Screenshot and Hero Layout
1. In `page.tsx`, move the screenshot markup to its own section below the hero.
2. Adjust the hero section's container and grid classes to center or rebalance the remaining text (Title, Eyebrow, Subtitle, CTAs).
3. Ensure the screenshot section has appropriate padding to separate it from the hero and the "Why Agelum" section.

### Phase 3: Final Polishing
1. Check mobile responsiveness. The top-right logo might need to be centered or adjusted for very small screens.
2. Ensure animations (`fade-in`, `delay-1`, etc.) still flow logically with the new sequence.
