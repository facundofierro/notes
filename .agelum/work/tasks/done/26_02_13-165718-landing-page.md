# Landing Page for Agelum Notes

## Overview

Create a beautiful, modern landing page for Agelum Notes at `apps/site` that showcases the product and inspires developers to try it for free.

## Target Audience

- Any developer who wants to bring order to their development workflow
- Developers who need to manage project documentation
- Solo developers and small teams looking for lightweight task management
- AI-assisted developers who want organized context for their tools
- Open-source maintainers managing specs, tasks, and docs

## Marketing Strategy

### Core Value Proposition

**"Bring order to your development workflow with no vendor lock-in, supporting many AI tools."**

Agelum Notes bridges the gap between scattered markdown files and rigid project management tools. It's designed for developers who:

- Want to stay in markdown (not another SaaS lock-in)
- Need to organize specs, tasks, and docs in one place
- Use AI coding tools and need structured context
- Prefer local-first, file-based workflows
- Want to use their preferred CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Opencode, Crush, Grok, Aider, Kimi code) and IDE (Cursor)

### Key Messaging Pillars

1. **Markdown-Native, Developer-First**
   - Your data lives in `.md` files you own
   - No proprietary formats or vendor lock-in
   - Works with your existing Git workflow

2. **Built for the AI Era**
   - MCP server for programmatic access
   - Structured context for AI coding assistants
   - Works with Claude CLI, OpenAI CLI, Ollama, LM Studio, and more
   - Full IDE integration with Cursor

3. **Lightweight yet Powerful**
   - Simple Kanban for task management
   - Organize by epics, tasks, and ideas
   - Everything in one beautiful interface

## Landing Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section

- **Headline:** "Your Code Deserves Better Notes"
- **Subheadline:** "The AI-ready project management tool that lives in your repo. Markdown-native, developer-focused, built for the age of AI coding."
- **CTA:** "Try Agelum Free" + "View on GitHub"
- **Visual:** Animated terminal showing Agelum in action OR screenshot of the Kanban board

### 2. Problem/Solution (Bento Cards)

Use a Bento grid layout to showcase features:

**Card 1: Tasks That Stay With Your Code**

- Visual: Kanban board screenshot
- Text: "No more Jira tickets drifting from your codebase. Tasks live in your repo as markdown files."

**Card 2: Specifications, Not Just Docs**

- Visual: Split view of spec file and implementation
- Text: "Write specs that AI can understand. Structured markdown that powers your development workflow."

**Card 3: AI Context, Organized**

- Visual: MCP server diagram
- Text: "Give your AI tools the context they need. MCP server provides structured access to your entire project."

**Card 4: Local-First, Always Yours**

- Visual: Git workflow illustration
- Text: "Your data, your files, your control. No cloud lock-in. Just markdown in a folder you own."

**Card 5: Developer Experience, Obsessed**

- Visual: Command palette or keyboard shortcut hint
- Text: "Keyboard-first navigation. Dark mode by default. Works offline. Built by developers, for developers."

**Card 6: From Backlog to Done**

- Visual: Task state transition animation
- Text: "Simple Kanban workflow: backlog → doing → done. No ceremonies, just progress."

### 3. How It Works (3 Steps)

### 7. Final CTA Section

- **Subheadline:** "Join developers who've traded scattered notes and rigid PM tools for Agelum."
- **CTA:** "Get Started Free" + secondary "Read the Docs"
- **Trust badge:** "Free forever • No signup required"

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

- **Dark mode first** (developer aesthetic)
- **Minimalist** with intentional accent colors
- **Typography:** Clean mono for code elements, modern sans for body
- **Animations:** Subtle, purposeful (not distracting)
- **Cards:** Glassmorphism or clean bordered cards

### Color Palette (Suggestions)

- Primary: Electric blue or purple (tech/innovation)
- Background: Deep charcoal / near-black
- Surface: Slightly lighter grays for cards
- Accent: Green (success/shipping) or amber (energy)

### Bento Card Grid

Consider asymmetric layouts:

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│  Hero   │   AI    │  Local  │
│  Card   │ Context │  First  │
│ (large) │         │         │
├─────────┼─────────┴─────────┤
│  Tasks  │    Developer      │
│         │    Experience     │
├─────────┴─────────┬─────────┤
│   Specifications  │  Ship   │
│                   │         │
└───────────────────┴─────────┘
```
