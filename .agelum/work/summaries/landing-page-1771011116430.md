# Summary

Implemented a complete marketing landing page for Agelum Notes in `apps/site`, based on the task requirements.

## What I changed

- Created `apps/site/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Added app metadata (title + description) for the landing page.
  - Wired global stylesheet import.

- Created `apps/site/src/app/globals.css`
  - Added a dark-first visual system with CSS variables.
  - Implemented responsive layout styles for all sections.
  - Added intentional visual treatment: layered gradients, glass-style cards, shadows, and subtle reveal animations.
  - Added expressive non-default typography stacks for sans and mono usage.

- Created `apps/site/src/app/page.tsx`
  - Implemented all required sections from the task:
    - Hero with required headline, subheadline, and CTAs.
    - Problem/Solution bento grid with 6 feature cards.
    - 3-step “How It Works” flow.
    - 3 persona-based use cases.
    - Social proof/testimonial placeholders.
    - 3-tier pricing section (Free, Pro coming soon, Team coming soon).
    - Final CTA section with trust badge.
  - Added iconography and clear product messaging aligned to the provided value proposition.

## Validation

- Ran build: `pnpm --filter @agelum/site build`
- Result: successful production build and type/lint checks for `@agelum/site`.

## Notes

- Initial build attempt failed due to blocked network access to Google Fonts.
- Resolved by switching to local font stacks in CSS, preserving design direction while ensuring offline-compatible builds.
