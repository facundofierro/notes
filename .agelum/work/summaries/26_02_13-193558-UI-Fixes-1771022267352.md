# Summary: 26_02_13-193558-UI-Fixes

## Changes Made

Removed the annotation badge components (numbered circles) from the screenshot viewer and annotation modal. These were the red/orange/blue circular badges that displayed annotation IDs on the screenshot.

### Files Modified

1. **apps/web/src/components/features/browser/capture/ScreenshotViewer.tsx**
   - Removed the "Annotation badges" section (lines 310-347) that rendered numbered badge circles on the screenshot

2. **apps/web/src/components/features/browser/capture/ScreenshotAnnotationModal.tsx**
   - Removed the "Annotation badges" section (lines 272-307) that rendered numbered badge circles in the annotation modal

## Rationale

The task annotation indicated: "Where is the red square with number 1 we need to remove these components."

The annotation badges displayed colored circles with numbers indicating each annotation's ID. The "red square with number 1" referred to a badge of type "remove" (which had a red background) with ID 1. These components have been removed from both the ScreenshotViewer and ScreenshotAnnotationModal.
