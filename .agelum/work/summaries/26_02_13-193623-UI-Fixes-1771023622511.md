# Summary - UI Fixes (Repetitive Components Removal)

Removed redundant download components from the landing page in the `site` application.

## Changes Made

### `@agelum/site`

- **`apps/site/src/app/page.tsx`**:
    - Removed the "Download for Free" button and the platform list ("macOS • Windows • Linux") from the `final-cta` section.
    - This was done to eliminate redundancy, as specific download buttons for each platform are already provided in the preceding "Download" section.

## Verification Results

- Verified the changes against the provided screenshot (red square with number 1).
- The `final-cta` section now only contains the heading and descriptive text, keeping the focus on the main call to action without redundant links.
