# Summary - UI Fixes (Logo & Screenshot)

I have successfully relocated the logo to the top right with a vertical layout and moved the application screenshot to a dedicated section for better visibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Logo Relocation and Layout
- Created a new `header` component in `apps/site/src/app/page.tsx` that contains the `brand-logo`.
- Positioned the logo at the top right of the container using a new `.top-nav` class in `globals.css`.
- Updated the `.brand-logo` style to use a vertical layout (`flex-direction: column`) with `align-items: flex-end`.
- Adjusted the "notes" text position with a negative margin to align it closely with "Agelum".
- Ensured the logo is centered on mobile devices (screens smaller than 640px).

### 2. Hero Section Refactoring
- Removed the logo and the screenshot from the hero section.
- Centered the hero content (eyebrow, title, subtitle, and CTAs) using helper classes `.text-center`, `.mx-auto`, and `.justify-center`.
- Simplified the hero layout by replacing the grid with a centered content area.

### 3. Screenshot Section
- Created a new section specifically for the application screenshot immediately following the hero section.
- Wrapped the screenshot in a `.container` and applied the `.screenshot-frame` style.
- Increased the `Image` component's dimensions to `1600x900` to allow for a larger and clearer display.
- Added `pt-0` to the section to maintain appropriate spacing with the hero content.

### 4. Styles and Helpers
- Added several utility-like classes to `globals.css` to support the new centered layout:
  - `.hero-content` for centering the hero text.
  - `.text-center`, `.mx-auto`, `.justify-center`, and `.pt-0` for layout control.
- Updated media queries to handle mobile responsiveness for the new header and hero layout.

## Verification
- Verified the structural changes in `apps/site/src/app/page.tsx`.
- Verified the style updates in `apps/site/src/app/globals.css`.
- The logo now appears at the top right in a vertical stack, and the screenshot is prominently displayed in its own section below the hero text.
