# Summary - UI Fixes (Logo Removal)

## Task Overview
The goal was to address UI fixes on the landing page of the `site` application, specifically removing the logo component from the top and ensuring the screenshot is prominently displayed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Logo Removal (`apps/site/src/app/page.tsx`)
- Removed the `<header>` component from the beginning of the `HomePage` component. This header contained the "Agelum notes" brand logo.
- This change was made based on the user's specific instruction to delete the component at the beginning of the landing page.

### 2. Screenshot Section (Already Implemented)
- The screenshot was already located in its own section immediately following the hero section, which aligns with the implementation plan's requirement to make it bigger and more visible.
- The `screenshot-frame` is styled for full container width and uses a high-resolution `Image` component.

### 3. Style Consolidation
- The styles for `.top-nav`, `.brand-logo`, `.brand-agelum`, and `.brand-notes` remain in `globals.css` but are no longer active on the landing page since the component was removed.

## Verification
- Checked `page.tsx` to ensure the header is gone.
- Verified that the hero section is now the first content in the `<main>` tag.
- Confirmed the screenshot section remains below the hero.
